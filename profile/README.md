# URI Industrial & Systems Engineering Research

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Systems Engineering research group at the **University of Rhode Island**.

We focus on the intersection of **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**, **Industrial Cybersecurity**, and **Intelligent Manufacturing**. Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical optimization models and resilient, real-world deployment in contested or high-interference environments.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

### 🧠 AI, Optimization & Scheduling
We apply Industry 4.0 concepts to solve complex manufacturing problems.
* **Machine Learning:** Leveraging high-performance computing for data-driven decision-making in production environments.
* **Operations Research:** Optimization of scheduling and resource allocation within manufacturing execution systems (MES).
* **Cyber-Physical Security:** analyzing security gaps in physical machines (CNC, PLC) using data-driven anomaly detection.

### 🏭 Digital Twins & Simulation
We utilize high-fidelity simulations to benchmark physical hardware against cyber-threats before deployment.
* **Integration:** ROS2 nodes synchronized with Unity environments.
* **Chaos Engineering:** Injecting faults (e.g., packet loss, ARP Cache Poisoning) to validate system recovery times (MTTR).
* **Hardware:** Integration with Niryo robotics, Raspberry Pi supervisors, and Arduino-based sensor arrays.

### 🛡️ Resilient Command & Control (C2)
We are developing "Edge-First" frameworks for deployable manufacturing cells. Our research moves away from fragile "Cloud-First" paradigms to create decentralized, autonomous networks capable of surviving connectivity loss.
* **Key Tech:** Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), LoRa/Wi-Fi.
* **Focus:** Decentralized identity, local authority recovery, and preventing "Kill Switch" effects in contested logistics.

## 📚 Lab Resources & Culture

We believe in open collaboration and technical proficiency. This organization hosts repositories for:

* **Thesis & Research Code:** The development of the Master's and Doctoral Projects.
* **Capstone Support:** Technical references and templates for undergraduate Senior Design projects, specifically regarding Cybersecurity and Manufacturing integration.
